# Superstore-SQL-Project

Mini SQL Project on Superstore Dataset (MySQL Workbench)
+ **Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/superstore-marketing-campaign-dataset
+ **Summary**
  + I complete a purchasing source analysis to understand which shopping channels customers are purchasing from (website, catalog, in-store). I also analyze for marketing campaign optimization by understanding the rate that which various customer segments accept the previous campaign. 
  + If I had access to more of the store's data, I would be able to understand further which shopping channels drive the highest quality traffic by calculating the conversion rate (CVR) from website session to order, average order value (AOV), or revenue per user (RPU). For example, I would be able to do these calculations if I had access to information on each customer purchase (total spent during each trip to store or what items the customer bought), information on each website session, or information of products sold at superstore.
  + I would also be able to improve my analysis for marketing campaign optimization if I the Kaggle dataset disclosed the date of which the campaign occurred and, again, access to customer orders and their respective dates. If so, I could see how conversion rate (CVR) from website session to order or average order value (AOV) are affected before and after the campaign.
